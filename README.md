# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction
This project explores predicting Boston housing prices using several regression techniques. The analysis utilizes the classic Boston Housing dataset and implements:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) Regularization
- Elastic Net Regularization
- Early Stopping for model selection and overfitting prevention
- Support Vector Regressor
- Descision Trees
- random Forest classifier
